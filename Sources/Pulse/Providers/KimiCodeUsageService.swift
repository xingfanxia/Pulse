/// The reply has **two kinds of limit in it and they are not the same figure**:
///
/// - `limits[]` — windows the service actually times, each stating a duration
///   and a unit (300 minutes, say). These are read as they are given.
/// - `usage` — the weekly allowance. The reply gives it a reset time and no
///   length, and the reset can land anywhere inside the week since the window
///   rolls, so the length is not inferable from it — it is named from what the
///   plan actually is.
///
/// Every count arrives as a *string*, and `detail` reports what is left rather
/// than what is spent, so both are converted here and everything downstream
/// stays in whole numbers of what is gone.
