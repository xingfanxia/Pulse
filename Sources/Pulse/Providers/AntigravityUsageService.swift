/// stored login to borrow: Antigravity starts a `language_server` process of
/// its own and talks to it over HTTPS on the loopback interface, and that
/// process is the only thing that knows the quota. So this is the one provider
/// whose figures exist **only while something of Antigravity's is running** —
/// which is what `.antigravityNotRunning` says, rather than dressing it up as
/// a failure.
///
/// Three things have to be found, and not one of them can be assumed:
/// - **the process**, which lives inside an app bundle rather than on `PATH`;
/// - **the port**, because the server is started with `--https_server_port 0`,
///   meaning "take any free one" — it is a different port on every launch, so
///   anything hardcoded is wrong by the next restart;
/// - **the CSRF token**, a per-launch UUID passed on the command line. Without
///   it the server answers `unauthenticated`, and it is the reason this can
///   only ever read the quota of the Antigravity running as this same user.
///
/// **More than one process can match, and most of them are the wrong one.**
/// Antigravity IDE runs two language servers and only one answers; the other
/// refuses this RPC outright. Taking the first match and giving up if it did
/// not work was a real fault — measured, the one that answers was second.
/// Every candidate is tried, and every port each of them listens on.
