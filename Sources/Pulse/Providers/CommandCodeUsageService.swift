/// Command Code's plan limits, credit pool and org spend limits.
///
/// Command Code is a terminal coding agent published by CommandCodeAI and
/// installed from npm as `command-code` (its binaries are `cmd`, `cmdc`,
/// `command-code` and `commandcode`). It bills a **credit balance in US
/// dollars** rather than a token allowance, and layers rolling usage windows
/// and per-organisation spend limits on top of it.
///
/// The credential comes from one of two places, in this order:
///
/// 1. **A key pasted into Settings**, kept encrypted on this Mac. It wins, for
///    the same reason it does for OpenCode Go: somebody who typed a key meant
///    that one, and a stale login left behind by the CLI should not quietly
///    override a deliberate choice.
/// 2. **What `cmd auth login` saved**, in `~/.commandcode/auth.json` — a plain
///    JSON object carrying `apiKey` alongside `userId`, `userName`, `keyName`
///    and `authenticatedAt`, written owner-only.
///
/// The CLI also honours a `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` environment variable. That is
/// deliberately **not** read here: Pulse is a launched app and does not inherit
/// the user's shell environment, so looking would find nothing on the machines
/// where it is set and would only add a way to be confusing about it.
///
/// ## The route
///
/// Four undocumented account routes on `https://api.commandcode.ai`, each
/// carrying `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` — the same four the CLI's own
/// `/usage` overlay reads, in the same order:
///
/// - `GET /alpha/whoami?limits=1` — the organisation id the other three are
///   scoped by, and the org's spend limits.
/// - `GET /alpha/billing/credits` — the remaining credit, split into monthly,
///   purchased and free, plus the rolling window limits.
/// - `GET /alpha/billing/subscriptions` — the plan and the billing period.
/// - `GET /alpha/usage/summary?since=<period start>` — what has been spent
///   inside that period.
///
/// None of this is documented by the vendor; it can change without notice,
/// exactly like the undocumented routes the other agents here are read from.
///
/// **What is not done:** the CLI carries a hard-coded table of monthly credit
/// allowances per plan id and prefers it as the denominator when a subscription
/// is active. Pulse does not use it. A number that lives in a client rather
/// than in the reply is not something the provider reported, and building a
/// percentage on it would be exactly the invention this app does not make. The
/// pool used here is what the account actually said: the credit still there
/// plus the money already spent in this period — which is the CLI's own
/// fallback whenever it has no plan entry to reach for.
