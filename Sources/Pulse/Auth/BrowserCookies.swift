/// comes back goes straight into the caller's own encrypted store.
///
/// This exists because Ollama has no quota API at all: the figures come from a
/// signed-in page, so a browser session is the only credential there is. Every
/// other provider in Pulse borrows a login its own tool stored, which is
/// cheaper and quieter, and none of them needs this.
///
/// **What it costs is different per browser, and the user has to be told.**
/// Firefox keeps cookies in plain SQLite and needs no permission at all.
/// Safari's file is inside its container and needs Full Disk Access, which is
/// granted per application — so a `swift run` build cannot have it and only
/// the bundled app can. Chromium encrypts its values with a key kept in the
/// login keychain, so reading them raises the "Pulse wants to use your
/// confidential information" prompt.
///
/// **The default browser is tried first regardless**, which is a decision
/// taken deliberately over trying the free ones first. The browser the user
/// opens links with is where they are actually signed in; the others may hold
/// a session that is months stale, and finding *that* is worse than a prompt.
