/// Whether Claude Code and Codex are working, read from the transcripts their
/// CLIs write as they go.
///
/// The obvious approach — "written to in the last N seconds" — is wrong in
/// both directions at once, and no value of N fixes it. A turn that is running
/// a slow tool writes nothing for minutes, so a short N stops the spinner
/// while the agent is still busy; a finished turn goes on spinning for the
/// rest of N. What is actually wanted is *is this turn still in flight*, and
/// both tools happen to say so outright:
///
/// - Claude Code stamps every assistant record with a `stop_reason`.
///   `tool_use` means it is handing off to a tool and will be back; `end_turn`
///   means the turn is over. A trailing `user` record — a prompt, or a tool's
///   result coming back — means it is the model's move, unless it is the one
///   Claude Code writes when the turn is interrupted.
/// - Codex brackets each turn with `task_started` and `task_complete` events,
///   and its tool calls and their results say which half of a turn is in
///   flight.
///
/// So only the tail of the newest transcripts is read, and the answer is exact
/// rather than a guess with a timer attached.
///
/// A timer is still needed for one case — a session that *died* mid-turn, from
/// a force quit, a crash, or a lid closed — because the transcript's last word
/// then claims a turn that will never finish. What that timer is worth
/// depends on what the turn was waiting for, which is why `Wait` exists.
