/// session transcripts carry token counts but no limits, and `rateLimits` only
/// appears there on a rate-limit *error*. What it does do — documented at
/// code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline — is pipe a JSON blob to whatever command
/// you register as your status line after every response, and that blob carries
/// `rate_limits.five_hour` and `rate_limits.seven_day` with the official
/// `used_percentage` and `resets_at`.
///
/// So Pulse registers itself as that command. Run as `Pulse --statusline`, it
/// reads the blob from stdin, keeps the usage part, and prints a status line
/// back for Claude Code to display.
///
/// The catch is that this is a push, not a pull: the figures only refresh while
/// a Claude Code session is running. Between sessions the reading is whatever
/// it was when you last used it, which is why `ClaudeCodeUsageService` reports
/// its age rather than presenting it as current.
