# Changelog

What each release changed, written for somebody deciding whether to install it.

This file is the source for both the GitHub release page and the text Sparkle
shows in the update window — see [Scripts/changelog.py](Scripts/changelog.py).
Add the entry **before** tagging, in the small grammar the converter knows:
bullets, `**bold**`, `` `code` `` and `[links](https://example.com)`.

## 1.0.9

- **Command Code is the sixteenth provider.** It bills a credit balance in dollars rather than a token allowance, so the rings are money: the rolling 5-hour and weekly limits, your organisation's spend limits, and how much of this month's plan is gone. That last one is marked **estimated** on the card, and it is the one thing here Pulse has to infer — Command Code reports what is **left** of a plan's monthly credit but never what the plan grants, which is published on its pricing page instead. A plan Pulse cannot size shows no monthly row at all rather than a reassuring zero. Sign in by pasting a key, or let Pulse borrow the one `cmd auth login` already saved.

- **The panel can follow you between displays.** Switch on "Follow the active display" and the rail moves to whichever screen your pointer is on, keeping the same corner and the same distance down it. There is still only one rail — it is carried across, not copied onto every monitor — and it stays where you last dragged it if you leave the setting off, which is how it ships. "Active" means the display the pointer is on and nothing else: it does not chase other apps' windows around, and it asks for no extra permission to work out where you are.

## 1.0.8

- **The interface follows your Mac's language.** Pulse now declares that it speaks Chinese, which it always did — the translations shipped, macOS just was not told they existed, so a Mac set to 简体中文 got an English app. If that was you, this update switches over on its own; if you preferred it in English, Settings › Language still overrides. The Chinese copy has been rewritten throughout while we were in there.

- **Antigravity can show its two allowances as two rings.** The plan carries one budget for Gemini and a separate one for Claude and GPT, and until now a single ring could only follow whichever was busier — the other went unmentioned unless you hovered. Switch on "A ring for each model group" in Antigravity's settings and each gets its own ring, both under the Antigravity icon, both refreshing the one login. Off by default: an extra ring takes room on the rail, and most people want the one number.

- **智谱 and z.ai get a usage history**, read from the same statistics the console draws its own charts from. Unlike the history Pulse builds for Claude Code and Codex — which it works out by reading session files on this Mac — this one comes from the account, so it covers every machine you use it on. It counts tokens only: the figures behind it cannot be turned into money, and the card says so rather than printing a confident zero.

- **A second limit on the ring.** A thinner ring inside the first shows the next-fullest limit *of the same kind* — the 5-hour beside the weekly it belongs with — so both are readable without hovering. Where a provider splits its allowance by model, the two arcs come from the same allowance wherever it has a second limit to show: pairing one model's weekly with another's 5-hour would put two unrelated budgets on one mark. Off by default and switched on in Settings; the ring is the thing you read without stopping, and two arcs is twice as much to take in. Where a provider reports only one limit nothing is added.

- **The panel no longer slides out from under you as you pick it up.** On a display where the panel is taller than the space under the menu bar — which is most laptops — macOS quietly refuses the position Pulse asks for, and Pulse was then drawing the rail relative to a position the window never had. It jumped about one ring's worth on the first frame of a drag. It tracks the pointer exactly now.

- **The two GLM Coding Plan rows are now named for the shops** — **z.ai** and **智谱**. They were "Z.ai" and "GLM Coding Plan", which was a trap: both shops sell the plan under that same name, so anyone on the international plan picked the row named after their product and had their key sent to the mainland service, which of course refused it.
- **A refused key now says the key was refused.** These services answer with an ordinary HTTP 200 and put the verdict inside, and Pulse only recognised the English wording and two of the numbers — so the most common mistake of all, a key from the other one of the two shops, came out as "the service returned an error" and sent people looking for an outage that was not happening.

## 1.0.7

- **Pulse can tell you, instead of waiting to be looked at.** Three switches in Settings, all off until you turn them on. **Warn at** posts a notification when a limit passes 75, 80, 90 or 95% — whichever you pick — and again when the provider says it is spent. **When a limit comes back** says so once the window you were warned about has turned over, which is the moment you can start again. **When a reading stops arriving** is the one that is about Pulse rather than about usage: a failed check falls back to the last good figures, which is the right thing to show and also the reason the fault is invisible — the panel goes on displaying perfectly plausible numbers with only a "last read" time to give it away. It waits for three failures in a row and then says it once, with the same sentence the card would have shown you.
- **It says each thing once.** A limit already past the line when you switch this on is mentioned straight away — silence followed by a wall is not restraint — and then never again until it resets or gets worse. "Spent" is the provider's own word, never a rounding of ours. A reset is announced only on unambiguous evidence, so a rolling weekly allowance sliding down a few points is not mistaken for a window turning over. And a provider you have never set up, or an app that simply is not running, is not a failure to be reminded of on a timer.
- **Antigravity reads from the IDE too**, not only the desktop app. If Antigravity IDE is the one you have open, its ring said “Open Antigravity to see its usage” while the figures were sitting there for the asking. Both report the same thing — the Gemini and the Claude-and-GPT group, weekly and five-hour each.
- **Antigravity could pick the wrong helper and give up.** It runs more than one of these, only one of them answers, and Pulse asked the first it found and stopped.
- **Reorder the rail by dragging.** The arrows are still there — they are the precise way to move one place, and the only way that works from the keyboard — but with fifteen providers, moving the bottom one to the top was fourteen clicks. There is a Reset order button under the list for when a drag goes somewhere you didn't mean.
- **Volcengine**, bringing it to fifteen. The Ark Coding Plan and Agent Plan, personal and team, each with its five-hour, weekly and monthly windows. Two ways in: `arkcli`, using the login it already saved so there is nothing to paste, or a Volcengine access key pair for anyone who has keys but doesn't run the CLI here. With both set up it prefers the keys — the CLI carries a sign-in that can belong to a different account, and quietly showing the wrong account's limits is worse than either answer.
- **`Pulse --json`**, so the figures can go somewhere other than the panel — a tmux status line, sketchybar, Raycast, a shell prompt. It prints what the app last read rather than fetching, so polling it every second costs nothing and asks no provider anything; every account says when its figures were taken and how old they are. Nothing in the output is translated, so a script parsing it does not break when you change the interface language.
- **Settings has a search field**, since the sidebar now lists fifteen providers plus whatever accounts you have added. It matches the provider's name as well as your own label, so a second Claude subscription you called "work" is still found by typing Claude.
- **The Settings window opens bigger.** It was sized when the sidebar held four rows and had got to the point of appearing already scrolled in both columns.
- Notifications come with the standard notification sound. Silence them, or change anything else about how they arrive, in System Settings › Notifications › Pulse — the same place as every other app.

## 1.0.6

- **Grok**, read from the login Grok Build's CLI already stores — nothing to paste. One thing worth knowing before the ring confuses you: since June 2026 a paid Grok plan spends **one weekly pool across every Grok product** — the web chat, Imagine, voice, the API and the CLI alike — so this is what the account has spent this week, not what the CLI has. That is why it is called Grok rather than Grok Build.
- **Grok Bot**, which is a different limit despite the name. It comes with a Cursor plan rather than a SuperGrok one, so it is read with the login the Cursor editor already stores and carries the xAI mark to tell the two apart on the rail. It appears by itself only if the standalone app is installed; otherwise switch it on in Settings.
- **A second account of either.** Grok signs in with a device code, Grok Bot through Cursor's own sign-in page. Both ask for the narrowest access that can read a limit — never for permission to read or write your conversations.
- A card could print a window length the provider never reported. Some limits carry a length that only exists to sort the rows — a rolling week, a billing cycle — and when there was no reset time to show, that length was printed as though it were one.
- A provider with a single route named the wrong one in Settings. Every such provider but Cursor was described as "Antigravity's language server", about an app it had nothing to do with.

## 1.0.5

- **Claude Code read through the Claude desktop app.** If you work in the desktop app rather than a terminal, Pulse had no way to see your limits: the desktop app hands the CLI a token through its own environment and renews it itself, so the login Pulse was reading went stale and never came back, and it never renders a status line either. Pulse can now read the session the desktop app is signed in with — a new "Desktop app" choice under Read usage from, and the route `Automatic` falls back to once you have allowed it. It asks for the keychain once, at launch, so there is nothing to go and find in Settings.
- **The new route says why it can't answer**, rather than leaving the last reading in place with nothing but its "Last read" time to give it away — which is what makes a refresh look as though it did nothing. It says whether the desktop app is signed out, or whether it was the keychain that was refused.
- **A reading could go backwards.** A newer figure already on file could be replaced on screen by an older one that had just arrived, and a refresh that had been given up on could still overwrite the one that replaced it — including, for an added account, the renewed login itself.
- **GitHub Copilot no longer shows a red ring for paid overage.** Going past the included allowance with overage permitted is not being blocked, and it was being drawn as though it were.
- **Codex no longer marks the wrong model group as spent.** A group reporting "limit reached" could put the mark on another group's window entirely.
- Removing your only added account no longer leaves the rail empty.

## 1.0.4

- **GitHub Copilot**, bringing it to twelve. Signs in with a device code, so there is no token to paste — Pulse asks GitHub for permission to read your profile and nothing else, and never for access to your repositories. Shows the completions, chat and premium-request allowances your plan actually has.
- **Whether a limit will last.** A switch in Settings puts one line under each limit on the card: whether it is on course to outlast its window, and roughly when it runs out if it isn't. Off by default, and it stays quiet when the figures can't carry it — the time only appears when it falls before the reset, and it is rounded, because usage comes in bursts and a figure to the minute would be made up.
- **Show what's left instead of what's spent.** Another switch, which turns the figure and the ring over together so a limit reads "88% left" rather than "12% used". The colour still means how close you are, so a nearly empty ring is still red.
- **Claude Code's card names the plan** — "Max 5x", "Pro", "Team" — as every other provider's already did. The multiplier is part of it, since a Max 5x and a Max 20x are different products.
- **The panel could quietly stop refreshing** after running a long time, and only come back when you next started Claude Code in a terminal. It notices when its own readings have gone stale and asks again, recovers from a fetch that never returned, and refreshes when the Mac wakes as well as when the display does.

## 1.0.3

- **The panel can go on a second display.** Drag it across; it remembers which screen you left it on, and comes home if that screen is unplugged.
- **Four more providers**: the GLM Coding Plan and MiniMax, each with a separate entry for the international and the mainland service, since they are separate accounts with separate keys.
- **A second arc can show how far through the window the clock is**, so "80% used" can be read against how much of the window is left. Off by default, in Settings.
- **The figure can sit above the ring** instead of below it. Also in Settings.
- A provider that needs an API key is no longer switched on by itself — it waits in Settings rather than taking a place on the rail to ask for a key.
- One that has no key says so, instead of saying "Reading…" for ever.
- Claude Code no longer shows a limit that has already reset. If its saved login has expired and no session has run for a while, the stale window is dropped rather than shown with an old reset time.
- The update window now shows the release notes itself, rather than loading the GitHub page inside it.

## 1.0.2

- **Multiple accounts.** Sign in to a second Claude Code or Codex subscription and watch both at once, each with its own ring.
- **Cursor**, reported as the two pools its own account page shows.
- **Ollama Cloud**, from PcOffeeP's pull request — with the session read out of your browser rather than copied by hand.
- **The rail can dock along the top of the screen**, above the menu bar.
- **A colour of your own for any ring**, and the gap between rings is now adjustable.
- **Percentages can be switched off** on either rail.
- The rail opens with the last reading instead of sitting blank.
- The activity mark no longer keeps turning for a minute after a turn has ended.
- The API-key field in Settings lets go when you click away from it.
- A limit you have used never reads as 0% any more.
- Quitting Codex no longer takes Pulse down with it.
- A new app icon, drawn on Apple's icon grid.

## 1.0.1

- **OpenCode Go** and **Kimi Code**, bringing it to five agents.
- **Put the rings in your own order**, in Settings.
- **A refresh button on every provider's pane**, with the age of the reading beside it.
- A new install starts with the agents you actually have, rather than five rings that say "not configured".
- The panel can be dragged by any part of the capsule, not only by its rings.
- Clicking a ring refreshes the one you clicked, whatever order the rail is in.
- The detail card no longer truncates itself at Small or sit half empty at Large.

## 1.0.0

- The first release. A floating rail of rings against the edge of the screen, one per coding agent, showing how much of each limit is left.
