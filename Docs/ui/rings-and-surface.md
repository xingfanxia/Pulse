# Rings and surface

## Liquid Glass

Optional, **off by default** (`AppSettings.usesGlass`, `PanelSurface`). Black stays default because the panel sits over the user’s work all day.

- Do **not** scrim the glass. `Glass.tint` is a hue, not a darkening. Content uses `.primary`, not hardcoded white. Pin dark appearance **only** when glass is off, via `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` — not `preferredColorScheme` (window-wide).
- Do **not** take the surface out of hit testing. `allowsHitTesting(false)` is what stopped gap-dragging. The window takes the drag in `sendEvent` before any view sees the event. [input.md](input.md)
- Use `Glass.clear`, not `.regular`. `.regular` was measured (historical) as opaque milky white in a transparent panel. Needs macOS 26; `#available` with a vibrant blur behind it.

**Historical diagnosis is uncertain.** An older note blamed macOS 26 glass for swallowing input outside SwiftUI’s hit-testing chain (rings-only drag; forums thread 816366). The same symptom then appeared on the black panel once the berth stopped claiming presses. Current code claims the surface and takes events in `sendEvent`. **Do not claim real-input verification** for glass or black. Settings still add “Drag it by a ring while this is on.” when glass is enabled — that caption is current UI, not proof of the old diagnosis.

## Colour and spent

Colour means **usage**, not identity (`UsageTint`: green / amber / red / spent deep red). `Provider` carries no accent; the icon is the brand. Brand-coloured rings read as a warning (Claude’s orange at 3% used).

Per-account `RingTint` is opt-in. Spent still uses the spent colour (`UsageRingView.isSpent` from the **provider**, not from the fraction — a lock can happen well short of 100%). System colour well, stored as hex, converted through **sRGB**. No opacity (translucent reads as “no reading”).

Countdown (`showsRemaining`): arc follows the figure; colour still means closeness to the limit. No reading → empty track either way; spent fills the ring. Do not invert `nil` to a full “100% left” circle. [../refresh-and-data.md](../refresh-and-data.md)

## Hover halo

The pointed-at halo hangs on the **progress arc**, not the ring view. Its inward half is **masked**, not covered with a disc. A `.shadow` on the composed view draws behind the icon (antialiased edges leak tint). An opaque disc is invisible on black and a white coin on glass. A mask has no colour to get wrong.

## Window-clock arc

`showsWindowClock`, default off. **Outside** the usage ring (inside is the activity mark). Neutral, low opacity, not a second hue. Applied as an overlay **after** `.frame(width: diameter…)`, never a ZStack child (a wider child grew the usage ring). Nil when the provider gives `resetsAt` or length without the other; `reportsLength` must be true. Own 60s ticker, not the usage loop.

## Second ring

`showsSecondRing`, default off. `ProviderUsage.secondWindow(preferring:)` — **the fullest limit in the ring's own model group**, falling back to the fullest of everything else when that group holds nothing more. Nil where the provider reports one limit: an empty second ring reads as a limit at zero, or as a fault.

**The group comes first because a provider can report two independent budgets.** Antigravity reports four windows — a five-hour and a weekly for `Gemini`, the same pair for `Claude and GPT` — and they are separate pools. Pairing the ring's Gemini weekly with a Claude five-hour puts two unrelated budgets on one mark, with nothing to tell the reader they have been mixed. Same group, and the two rings answer one question: how much of *this* pool is gone, over five hours and over the week.

Claude Code falls out of the same rule: its five-hour and weekly limits are unscoped, so they are each other's group, and the model-scoped weekly is left to the card. Stated as "fullest" rather than "the weekly one" so it needs no table of which window each provider calls its long one, and so it keeps working when the ring is pinned. `max(by:)` keeps the first of equals, so a rail of untouched windows stays in the provider's own order instead of shuffling between passes.

**Inside, not outside.** Outside is the clock arc's, and the limit that matters most has to stay the outer, bigger, thicker one — so nothing moves for anybody who leaves this off. Same colour language as the first ring: two arcs measuring the same kind of thing must be read the same way, and a second hue would be a second vocabulary for one idea. Size and weight are what tell them apart. Spent fills it, whichever way it counts.

**It moves what is already in there**, which is why the geometry lives in `DockLayout.secondRing…` rather than as a constant in the view. It is deliberately **not** a `PanelMetrics` entry: nothing outside the ring changes size, so a copy of the flag in the metrics was written on every change and read by nothing. At standard scale the band between the icon disc and the ring's inner edge is 6pt, and the **activity mark rides the middle of it** — the one place a second arc wants, and the providers reporting two limits are exactly the two whose CLIs make it spin. With the ring on, the mark moves in against the disc and the disc gives up 2pt a side. The ring, the rail's width and the ring centres are unchanged.

The percent label under the ring still follows the **outer** limit only. Two figures in that space is a change to `DockLayout.percentTextWidth`, which is a budget the whole rail is measured from.

## One ring per model group

`AppSettings.splitAccounts`, default off, per account, and offered only where `Provider.splitsByModelGroup` is true — Antigravity alone. Its plan carries a Gemini allowance and a separate one for Claude and GPT, reported as two `scope`s of one login. They are independent budgets, so a single ring can only show the busier one and silently drop the other.

**The rail is slots, not accounts.** `RailSlot.rail(for:isSplit:groups:)` is the one place that order is decided, and both the panel's `entries` and `PanelHitArea.slot(at:)` go through it. They have to agree: a ring drawn at one position and refreshed from another is a fault nobody reports clearly. Each slot carries its account plus an optional group; `id` is `account@group`, so SwiftUI keeps the two rings apart.

**Two rules keep a limit from disappearing into the split, and both prefer one ring to a lost window.** `modelGroups(of:)` is all-or-nothing: a reading that mixes scoped and unscoped windows yields no groups, because splitting it would file every window under a scope and leave the unscoped ones belonging to no ring. And more groups than `modelGroupCount` leaves the account whole rather than taking the first two — the rail is budgeted for that many and a third would be drawn past its end, but truncating loses the third group's limits entirely. One ring showing the busiest of three is worse than two rings; it is not worse than a limit nobody can see.

**A split account keeps its single slot until a reading actually carries more than one group.** Before the first answer there is nothing to split by, and one ring that becomes two a second later beats two empty ones that may never fill. Groups come back in the provider's own reported order, not sorted — that order is what Antigravity's own screen shows.

Both rings are the same account: same icon, same tint, same key, same refresh. Clicking either refreshes the login, because one reading feeds both. What differs is the windows — `windows.filter { $0.scope == group }` — and the title, which appends the group so VoiceOver and the card do not read out the same thing twice.

**The budget moves with it.** `AppSettings.railSlotCount` counts a split account as `provider.modelGroupCount` (a fixed 2, not the groups a reading happens to carry, so the rail does not resize when a provider answers one group short) and feeds `PanelMetrics.makeRoom(for:)`. Off by default for the same reason: a second ring costs a slot, and the rail is the whole of the panel when docked.

## What may not be animated

The rail's `railTop` / `railLeading` offsets track a pointer, so they must sit **outside** `.animation(_:value:)`. That modifier animates everything animatable in its subtree whenever its value changes — and with the offsets inside the card's `value: selectedSlot` spring, the first frame of a drag closed the card, which sprang the rail's *position* too: the panel visibly slid away from the hand carrying it. The card's own reveal still animates; the offsets are applied after it, outside.

## Activity mark

White arc on the empty ring between icon disc and usage stroke — **or just outside the icon disc when the second ring is on**, see above. Core Animation, not `TimelineView`. Reset `spinning` on disappear. [../refresh-and-data.md](../refresh-and-data.md)

## Icons

`LobeIconView` is a template image with **no colour of its own**. Do not hardcode white there — settings sidebar needs the ordinary label colour.
