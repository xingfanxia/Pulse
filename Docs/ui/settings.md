# Settings window

Chrome and why it is AppKit-owned: [../architecture.md](../architecture.md). Localization rules: [../development.md](../development.md).

`SettingsView` / `SettingsRow`: `NavigationSplitView` source list, panes from `SettingsGroup` + `SettingsRow` (title + optional subtitle left, control right). `SettingsPane` includes `.provider(_:)` so each provider has a sidebar row.

The sidebar is `.searchable(placement: .sidebar)` — **not** `.automatic`: this window has no `NSToolbar`, so automatic placement has nowhere to put the field. Accounts match on the provider's name *as well as* the user's label, so a second Claude subscription called "工作" is still found by typing "claude". Matching is `localizedStandardContains` (case- and accent-insensitive, the same comparison Finder searches with). A section with no matches is omitted; nothing matching at all leaves a "No matches" line. The current selection is not cleared by a search that hides it — you keep your place.

## Copy

**Subtitles are one line.** Say what the control does. Reasoning belongs in docs, not on screen. Exceptions: the money card’s provenance and the estimate caption — those exist so an inferred figure is not read as reported.

A joined sentence needs no extra space after a Chinese full stop (`。`). `glassSubtitle` only inserts a separator when the first half does not end in one.

While Liquid Glass is on, the caption still says to drag the panel by a ring. That is current UI. The historical “glass swallows input” diagnosis is uncertain; [rings-and-surface.md](rings-and-surface.md).

Group order in the general pane: **Floating panel → Notifications → Refresh → Order → Application → Language**. The two groups that decide what Pulse does *on its own* sit directly under the panel group, above the housekeeping ones. Notifications was added at the bottom, between Refresh and Language, and that was too far down to find — the panel group alone is fifteen rows.

The usage-interval group is named **Refresh**, not Updates.

The **Notifications** group's three controls are not independent of each other: the reset toggle is greyed out while the threshold is Off, because a reset is only announced for a window that was warned about, and every control is greyed out in an unbundled build. Its subtitle reports `UNAuthorizationStatus`, not the switches. Rules: [../notifications.md](../notifications.md).

## Controls

SwiftUI `Picker` / `Menu` on macOS **cannot be given a width**. `.frame`, min/max, `fixedSize`, and a fixed-width custom label were measured (historical) and none moved the control. Right-align at `SettingsLayout.controlWidth` as a *ceiling*; long labels truncate. An `NSPopUpButton` wrapper did give a true 180pt box and was removed: short labels floated in empty chrome. Don’t rebuild it without checking that first.

Sidebar column: **min 200, ideal 220, max 320**. Sized to "GLM Coding Plan", the longest name in the list, with "GitHub Copilot" and "OpenCode Go" behind it — at the previous 170/180/220 all three truncated to an ellipsis, on a list whose only job is telling sixteen products apart. They are brand names, so the requirement does not move with the language. `min` is the half that matters: AppKit saves the divider position, so `ideal` is read once per install while `min` clamps everyone.

Default window: **920 × 660**, set on the `NSWindow`'s `contentRect`; the view's `minWidth` / `minHeight` (720 × 460) are what it can be dragged down to. It opened at 760 × 500 when the sidebar held four rows — with sixteen providers and a six-group general pane that meant a window that was scrolling in both columns the moment it appeared. The size is not remembered across launches: the window is rebuilt and `center()`ed on each one.

`ImageRenderer` cannot draw this window (split view + AppKit controls). Check by running the app.

## Provider panes

A provider with one route has that route **named**, and the name belongs to the provider (`Provider.soleRoute`). A ternary (Cursor vs else Antigravity) made the next single-route provider inherit Antigravity’s sentence. Exhaustive `Provider` switch; omit the row when nil.

Each pane has its own refresh, with last-reading time. Rail click is not the only way.

The Panel group's rows are per account: show, "Ring shows", ring colour — and, only where `Provider.splitsByModelGroup` is true, **"A ring for each model group"**. Drawn behind that flag rather than always with an explanation, because a switch that promises a second ring it can never draw is worse than no switch. Off by default; it costs a slot on the rail, and the rail is the whole of the panel when docked. [rings-and-surface.md](rings-and-surface.md)

Reorder by **dragging a row, or with the arrows** — both, deliberately. It was arrows only, on the reasoning that four rows is not enough to make a drag worth learning and that an arrow which misses does nothing while a drag which misses does something. The first half stopped being true at sixteen providers plus added accounts: bottom to top is fifteen clicks. The arrows stay because they are the precise one-place move, the only keyboard path, and the only one carrying accessibility labels.

A **Reset order** row closes the group, disabled unless `hasCustomOrder` — which compares the accounts, not whether anything is stored, because dragging a row down and back up leaves a full stored list that matches the default exactly. `resetOrder()` clears `providerOrder` rather than writing the default into it, so a provider added in a later version still arrives at the bottom of the rail instead of being pinned by a list written before it existed.

`AppSettings.move(_:onto:)` is "take its place": the dragged row is removed first, so dropping downward lands after the target and upward lands before it — both being what the pointer was pointing at. The payload is the account id as a plain `String`, so a text drag from another app can light a row up as a target; the drop is then rejected (`AccountKey(id:)` fails, or the id names no account Pulse has). A custom `UTType` would stop the highlight too, but only declared in the bundle's `Info.plist`, which would make `swift run` behave differently from the shipped app for a cosmetic case.

A first account that needs a credential Pulse hasn’t got is seeded with the reason, not `.loading`. `loadAPIKeys` rewrites that only over a placeholder.

Extra-account UI is only for `supportsMultipleAccounts` (Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Grok Bot). How sign-in works: [../providers/README.md](../providers/README.md).
