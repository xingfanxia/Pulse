# Pointer, drag, clicks

SwiftUI `.onHover` **does not work here**. It tracks only while the app is active. Pulse is `.accessory` behind a non-activating panel that never becomes key, so it is essentially never active.

Do not treat `hitTest` or synthesised `NSEvent`s as proof that a real click arrives. They have reported handles as reachable at widths the rail did not have, and they bypass whatever a material installs. Geometry probes are useful (“is this point in `grabArea`?”). Whether a person can drag the panel is **real input**, which this repo does not currently claim to have re-verified.

Why enter/leave are split, why the window owns the drag, and the Liquid Glass episode: [../decisions/hover-and-drag.md](../decisions/hover-and-drag.md), [../decisions/liquid-glass.md](../decisions/liquid-glass.md).

## Hover (open / close the card)

Two `NSViewRepresentable` backgrounds:

- `PointerEntryReporter` — `.activeAlways` `NSTrackingArea`, reports **only entering** a ring.
- `PanelPointerWatcher` — samples `NSEvent.mouseLocation` on a timer. `FloatingUsagePanelView.isOverContent` tests against the **rail and the card**, not the window frame (the panel is full-size and mostly transparent).

**Do not close on exit events.** Views appearing, moving, or animating under a stationary pointer fire spurious exits; closing reopens; it loops. Enter from tracking areas, leave from sampling the real pointer. That loop is then structurally impossible.

The sliver’s tracking area cannot be the only way `isHovered` gets set: a floating panel dragged onto an edge docks with `isHovered` still false and snaps shut in the hand. `pointerMoved` sets it from the same test that decides when to hide.

`PanelHitArea.stripIsContainedInRail()` asserts the sliver never pokes outside the rail’s hit area (or leave-rail lands on the sliver, which shows the rail, which hides it). Bound is rail capacity / slots, not `Provider.allCases.count`. Run from `FloatingPanelController.init` once metrics are settled.

## Drag belongs to the window

Two things, different files:

1. Something in the panel must **claim** the point or the window is never handed the press — `PanelSurface`, hit-testable, `contentShape` of the capsule. `allowsHitTesting(false)` killed dragging in the empty black between rings (rings still worked via tracking areas).
2. The press must be **taken** — `FloatingPanel.sendEvent`. A SwiftUI-hosted handle only sees a press if SwiftUI claims the point first. Laying a shape *over* the handle swallows the press. `sendEvent` sees events before SwiftUI hit testing and before anything Liquid Glass installs.

The window is handed **two** rects: `grabArea` (rail, or sliver when collapsed) decides whether a press is taken; `railFrame` (always the rail) is what placement arithmetic runs on. Collapsed, grabbing a 20pt sliver and placing it as a 64pt rail throws the panel across the screen. Both sized to what is drawn, or a press in the transparent band moves the panel instead of passing through.

## Ring click vs ring drag

Same window-level path. `FloatingPanel` records the press, marks a drag only after a real `leftMouseDragged`, reports a click on mouse-up otherwise. The press also sets `placement.isPressed`, and **nothing may move the panel while that is set** — not merely while `isDragging` is. The grab offset is measured at mouse-down, so a re-place in the gap before the first movement does not slide the panel, it makes it jump by that much on the frame the pointer first travels. `PanelHoldTests` pins it. `PanelHitArea.slot(at:)` accepts only the visible circle; labels and berth gaps stay drag-only. It indexes **slots**, not accounts — a split provider draws two rings from one login, so counting accounts aims every click after the split at the wrong ring. The controller builds the same list the panel draws from, through `RailSlot.rail(for:isSplit:groups:)`.

Click starts a provider-scoped refresh. `UsageStore.isRefreshing` : the usage arc **dims but does not move**; a short bright segment travels around. Do not rotate the usage arc (at 0% there is no arc; at 95% a rotated arc looks still; it also takes the gauge away). Travelling mark is usage colour, not white (white is the CLI-activity mark). Hold at least 650ms so a local read still registers. Keep the physical click here; `sendEvent` takes the press before SwiftUI. Default accessibility action can still live on the ring.

A click is matched against **displayed** order: `orderedProviders.filter(isEnabled)`, not `Provider.allCases`.

## Settings fields

Click-away ending editing is `SettingsWindow.sendEvent`, geometry vs the field, never `hitTest`. [settings.md](settings.md).
