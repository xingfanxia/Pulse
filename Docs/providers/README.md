# Providers

Pulse tracks **sixteen** `Provider` cases. There is no Pulse backend and no Pulse account. Each provider reports its own usage by whatever route that product actually offers — often an undocumented account endpoint the product itself calls, sometimes a documented usage path, sometimes a local helper that only exists while an editor is open.

This directory is the home for routes, credentials, cookies, extra logins, and the failure lessons that belong to those. Current service code is authoritative. Historical measurements and “do not repeat” notes are labelled as such. Nothing here claims a runtime test of a live account.

Shared types: [`../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/UsageProvider.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/UsageProvider.swift), [`../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/MonitoredAccount.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/MonitoredAccount.swift), [`../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/ProviderUsage.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/ProviderUsage.swift), [`../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/UsageSource.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/UsageSource.swift). Sign-in machinery: [authentication.md](authentication.md).

Ollama setup (how to read the session, what the page parser accepts) stays in [`../ollama-cloud.md`](../ollama-cloud.md). Do not duplicate it here.

## Current matrix

Declaration order in `Provider` is the order a new, unmentioned provider is appended to a stored rail.

| `Provider` | Ring name | Icon | Credential | Extra accounts | Route choice | Local transcripts | First-run evidence |

Per-provider pages: [claude-code.md](claude-code.md), [codex.md](codex.md), [antigravity.md](antigravity.md), [cursor.md](cursor.md), [opencode-go.md](opencode-go.md), [kimi-code.md](kimi-code.md), [ollama-cloud.md](ollama-cloud.md), [zai.md](zai.md), [minimax.md](minimax.md), [copilot.md](copilot.md), [grok.md](grok.md), [grok-bot.md](grok-bot.md), [volcengine.md](volcengine.md), [command-code.md](command-code.md).

Z.ai and GLM Coding Plan share [`ZaiUsageService.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/ZaiUsageService.swift). MiniMax and MiniMax CN share [`MiniMaxUsageService.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/MiniMaxUsageService.swift). Two rings, two accounts, two keys — not a region switch inside one provider.

## Shared contracts

Refresh loop, cache algorithm, ledger, and forecast: [`../refresh-and-data.md`](../refresh-and-data.md). First-run / offer-once / empty rail: [`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md). This page keeps **provider-specific** differences.

### Pulse does not invent a percentage

If a provider does not report a figure, the UI says so. Do not derive a percentage from that provider’s local token counts. Two labelled exceptions, each withheld when its inputs cannot carry it: the money estimate ([`../refresh-and-data.md`](../refresh-and-data.md)), and Command Code's monthly plan grant ([command-code.md](command-code.md)) — reported remainder, unreported plan size, and no row at all for a plan the table cannot size.

### Spent comes from the provider

A window’s `isExhausted` is the provider’s judgement (`severity` / `locked_reason`, `limit_reached`, a status other than `ok`, and so on), not “percentage ≥ 100”. A spend limit can run past 100%. An unrecognised severity is treated as spent — erring toward “you are blocked” is the safer mistake. Codex flags a whole *group*; the fullest window in that group is marked, not every sibling.

### Remaining vs spent

Downstream UI talks about what is **gone**. Services that receive “what is left” invert at the boundary: Antigravity, MiniMax, Copilot, and some Kimi `limits[].detail` fields. Grok Bot’s `usagePercent` is already spent, and so are Command Code’s spend limits and window limits — only its **credit balance** is what is left, and that is turned into a pool rather than inverted. Do not invert twice.

### `windowSeconds` is not evidence of a reported length

Some windows carry a length only so the row sorts: Kimi’s rolling week, Cursor’s 28–31 day billing cycle stored as 30, Copilot’s calendar month stored as 30, Grok Bot’s seven days when no reset is stated. `UsageWindow.reportsLength` is the flag. The window-clock arc and the forecast divide only when the provider stated a length. Displaying a sort key as “7 days” on the card was a real bug (`UsageDetailCard.resetText` used to fall back to `lengthText` whenever `resetsAt` was nil).

### Shared unavailability copy names no provider

`ProviderUsage.Unavailability` messages are reused. They originally all said “Codex”, so Claude Code reported “Codex is rate limiting these checks.” Shared cases (`.apiKeyMissing`, `.apiKeyRefused`, `.signedOut`, `.unreachable`, …) stay generic. Provider-specific cases exist where the *remedy* names a tool (`claudeLoginExpired`, `cursorSignInRequired`, `grokBotNotIncluded`, …). A Grok Bot primary that needs Cursor signed in is allowed to name Cursor: that is where the credential comes from.

There is no `.openCodeKeyRefused`. OpenCode Go uses `.apiKeyRefused` like the other key providers.

### Disabled providers are not fetched

A switched-off provider is not on the refresh pass. A provider’s own Settings pane can still refresh it by name while it is off. Shared loop: [`../refresh-and-data.md`](../refresh-and-data.md).

### First-run evidence (per provider)

Offer-once, `Key.hasRun` / `Key.offeredProviders`, empty-rail vs empty provider set: [`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md).

`canReportWithoutSetup` is not “needs no key”. Grok and Grok Bot borrow another tool’s login; with neither installed they would be switched on at the next update as grey rings saying “sign in to something you have never heard of”. Grok is gated on `~/.grok`; Grok Bot on the **standalone app**, not on a Cursor login (every Cursor user would otherwise get “your plan doesn’t include this”). OpenCode Go, mainland GLM and Command Code still count as ready when another tool already saved a key. Command Code’s test is that key, **not** `~/.commandcode`: the CLI creates that directory to unpack bundled skills into before anyone has signed in, so the directory says it ran here and nothing about whether there is an account behind it. The rest wait in Settings. They are still stamped as offered, so the decision is taken once.

### Seeded state is not “Loading…”

`UsageStore.initialState` does not seed every account as `.loading`. An account that needs a credential Pulse has not got never resolves while nothing is queued for it, and a Settings pane sat on “Reading…” indefinitely. It is seeded with the reason. `loadAPIKeys` rewrites that only over a placeholder, never over a reading actually taken.

### Cache (provider differences)

Shared drop/age/24h/cold-start rules: [`../refresh-and-data.md`](../refresh-and-data.md).

Do not paper over `.apiKeyMissing`, `.ollamaSessionMissing`, `.signedOut`, `.claudeDesktopNotSignedIn`, or `.claudeDesktopKeyRefused`. Claude Code’s status-line capture is marked `.live` for ten minutes (`freshFor`) even when an endpoint reading taken later exists — reconciliation is by `observedAt`, not by which route called itself live. See [claude-code.md](claude-code.md).

### Keys and logins Pulse keeps

Not the same question as “does Settings draw a paste field”.

- `usesAPIKey` — Settings paste UI: OpenCode Go, Kimi Code, Ollama Cloud, Z.ai, GLM Coding Plan, MiniMax, MiniMax CN, Volcengine, Command Code. Ollama’s value is a **session cookie** (`usesSessionCookie`); calling it an API key in Settings would send people looking for one that does not exist.
- `keepsOwnCredential` — Pulse stores something in `keys.dat`: the paste providers **plus Copilot**. Reading `usesAPIKey` where *storage* was meant left a signed-in Copilot account reporting “sign in again”: the token was saved and then never loaded for the fetch.
- Extra-account OAuth / Cursor web logins live in `accounts.dat`, not `keys.dat`. See [authentication.md](authentication.md).

OpenCode Go’s file comment still says it is the only provider Pulse holds a key for. That is **stale**. Current `usesAPIKey` / `keepsOwnCredential` in `UsageProvider` win.

Keys are read once per launch rather than once per refresh (`UsageStore.loadAPIKeys`).

### Source choice

Only Claude Code and Codex have `hasSourceChoice` (tied to `keepsLocalTranscripts`). `.automatic` is the default: endpoint when it can, the other route when it cannot. Pinning means a failure is *reported* rather than quietly answered from elsewhere.

`.desktopApp` is offered only on the **primary** Claude Code account. An added account’s picker must not offer a route `fetchAdded` would ignore.

`Provider.soleRoute` is an exhaustive switch. It used to be a ternary in Settings (Cursor’s wording, else Antigravity’s), so Grok’s pane read “Antigravity’s language server”. The row is not drawn when the answer is nil. For Grok Bot it names **Cursor’s** login, because that is whose bill it is.

An added Grok account is not shown the CLI-login row: `fetchAdded` never touches `~/.grok/auth.json`.

### Extra accounts

`supportsMultipleAccounts` is **Claude Code, Codex, Grok, and Grok Bot** — not “the two CLIs”. Cursor itself is not on the list: the same web sign-in would work, but Cursor’s usage summary is read from the editor’s stored login and a second account has no editor behind it. Grok Bot needs nothing but the token. See [authentication.md](authentication.md) and [`MonitoredAccount.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Usage/MonitoredAccount.swift).

A provider’s first account id is the provider’s raw value. That is the migration: stored preferences and cache files keep matching. Making an upgrade look like a fresh install has already cost a release.

### Transcripts, ledger, forecast

Counting, cache filename, burn-rate, and estimate rules: [`../refresh-and-data.md`](../refresh-and-data.md).

Only Claude Code and Codex set `keepsLocalTranscripts`, which gates the labelled money estimate and the “working right now” mark. **History is the wider `providesHistory`**: Z.ai and 智谱 answer it from the account's own statistics instead ([zai.md](zai.md)). Both are left out for everyone else rather than shown as zeroes. OpenCode *does* keep sessions (`opencode stats`); they live in OpenCode’s own store, not the JSONL the ledger reads, so the flag is false today.

Claude vs Codex token fields (exclude vs include cache; running total vs per-turn): [claude-code.md](claude-code.md), [codex.md](codex.md). Sort-key lengths (Kimi rolling week, Cursor/Copilot ~30-day stand-in, Grok Bot’s seven days without a stated reset) must keep `reportsLength: false` so they never feed the window clock or forecast.

## Adding a provider

A new case needs: `Provider` answers (`displayName`, `iconResource`, `keepsLocalTranscripts`, `providesHistory`, `hasSourceChoice` / `soleRoute`, `usesAPIKey` / `usesSessionCookie` / `keepsOwnCredential`, `canReportWithoutSetup` / first-run evidence, `supportsMultipleAccounts`), an SVG in `Sources/Pulse/Resources/`, a service returning `ProviderUsage`, branches in `UsageStore` refresh and `fetchAdded` if relevant, and this directory updated in the same patch. `AgentActivity` and `UsageLedger` already return optional roots, so an agent with no transcripts opts out there.

Do not document how to obtain someone else’s auth tokens in issues or the repo. Do not paste session cookies, keys, or page HTML into pull requests.
