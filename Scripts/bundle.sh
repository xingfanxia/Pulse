# Assembles Pulse.app from the SwiftPM build.
#
# Pulse has no Xcode project on purpose — it is a plain package, and this is
# what turns the package's bare executable into something macOS treats as an
# app. That matters for more than tidiness: without a bundle there is no
# version number to compare against (so no update check), `SMAppService` cannot
# register a login item, and there is nothing to hand anyone but a build folder.
#
#   ./Scripts/bundle.sh            → build.noindex/Pulse.app
#   ./Scripts/bundle.sh --zip      → and build.noindex/Pulse-<version>.zip to attach
#                                    to the release
#   ./Scripts/bundle.sh --open     → and reveal it in Finder
#
# The version comes from the VERSION file, which is the single source of truth:
# tag the release `v$(cat VERSION)` so the update check — which reads GitHub's
# latest release tag — is comparing like with like.
